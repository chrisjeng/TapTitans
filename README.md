# TapTitans

Compilation of iOS Tap Titans save files.

## How to use these files

1. Set up your stuff (see below)
2. Back up your stuff (as always)
3. Choose which save file you want to copy. All of these are from Chris Jeng, so in general, the later file you choose, the later in the game it'll be.
4. Contribute back.

### 1) Set up
You'll first need something like [iTools](http://itools-for-windows.en.softonic.com/) or [iFunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) to be able to read Tap Titan's file system of your iDevice. If you're using a Mac, you'll have to Google it (it exists). If you're looking to exploit glitches to earn diamonds, you might find it more convenient to jail break so you can install previous versions of the apps. See `ipa_files` for more on that.
### 2) Backup
By nature of this hacky industry business, you'll want to back up your stuff in case things go wrong. DO NOT proceed unless you have backed up your save file!
### 3) Choose
From there, navigate into your program's inner folder, then go to `Documents/`, and wipe your `.DAT` and your `.BAK` files with the given `912*.dat` and `912*.bak` files
