# TapTitans

Compilation of iOS Tap Titans save files.

## How to use these files

1. Set up your stuff (see below)
2. Back up your stuff! There's a good chance this janky stuff doesn't work, so be sure you've got something reliable to fall back on.
3. Choose which save file you want to copy. All of these are from Chris Jeng, so in general, the later file you choose, the later in the game it'll be.
4. Contribute back.

### 1) Set up
You'll first need something like [iTools](http://itools-for-windows.en.softonic.com/) or [iFunBox](http://www.i-funbox.com/) to be able to read Tap Titan's file system of your iDevice. Note: these softwares are for Windows. If you're looking to exploit glitches to earn diamonds, you might find it more convenient to jailbreak so you can install previous versions of the apps. See the `ipa_files/` folder for more on that.
### 2) Backup
By nature of this hacky industry business, you'll want to back up your stuff in case things go wrong. DO NOT proceed unless you have backed up your save file! There is an option in-game to upload to your iCloud, but that can **automatically get rewritten**, so I highly recommend you do a manual backup. To do a manual backup, use your explorer (such as iTools) and navigate to your `Tap Titans/Documents/` folder and copy the save files in here. See below to see which files are the save files.
### 3) Choose
From there, navigate into your program's inner folder, then go to `Documents/`, and wipe your `.DAT` and your `.BAK` files and replace them with the given `912*.dat` and `912*.bak` files. The `912*.dat` and `912*.bak` files are exactly your save files. Depending on your version, there may also be a file named something along the lines of `save.dat`, in which case you'll want to copy that too.
